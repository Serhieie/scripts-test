  "fullStackLetter": "Good day! I have experience working with cross-professional teams. We've successfully launched a live website, where I utilized the technologies that you're seeking from candidates. Additionally, I developed an admin page and backend for this site using Node.js and Express. As I mentioned, I have a passion for learning and am continuously improving my skills. I understand the importance of teamwork, creativity, attention to detail, self-motivation, and motivating others. These qualities, along with my ability to thrive under pressure, are assets that I believe will contribute significantly to our collaborative efforts. I'm excited about working with React, Redux, JavaScript, TypeScript, Solidity, HTML, and CSS. Additionally, I'm keen on improving my understanding of design patterns, SOLID principles, and algorithms. This application was sent with a script that I wrote in JavaScript.",
